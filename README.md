# Microblog -- a microblogging application from Miguel Grinberg's Tutorial
A hands-on project created through Miguel Grinberg's tutorial series in writing web application in Python using Flask microframework.

## Features:
This microblogging application features:
  - home page
  - profile page and avatar
  - follow and unfollow options
  - email support
  - edit profile
  - search other users (a feature I added instead of the full text search in the tutorial since flask-whooshalchemy is not compatible with Python versions 3 and up)
  - clickable image (another feature I added instead of clickable name as taught in the tutorial. This should redirect you to a user's profile page.)
  - I18n and L10n (currently supports Spanish translation only. Will work on supporting other languages in the future.)
  - CRUD
  - like and unlike posts posts

Other features are still being worked on as I continue with the tutorial.
